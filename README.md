## Summary
Online measurement of oxygen uptake rates (OUR) in Biomass can be utilized to control activated sludge (or wastewater). Modeling showed that this novel control strategy ensured year-round compliancy to total nitrogen discharge limits, contrary to mixed liquor and solids retention time control. In a pilot-scale high-rate contact-stabilization system, control based on online OUR instead of MLSS or SRT, successfully correlated with COD oxidation. At a vOUR setpoint of 22-24 mg O2 L-1 h-1, OUR control maintained a solids retention time (SRT) of 0.4 ± 0.2 days while preserving excellent bioflocculation. Approximately 55% of the incoming chemical oxygen demand (COD) was redirected and incorporated into the particulate COD fraction. Of the redirected COD, two thirds (66 ± 23%) was captured, resulting in 36% of the incoming COD sent to the digester. Controlling wasting rates to maintain a setpoint vOUR is an alternate approach for high-rate activated sludge system management.

## Introduction
Oxygen uptake rate (OUR) is an important biological parameter that quantifies the respiration rate of aerobic organisms. The respiration rate relates to the overall metabolic activity of the cell, which includes synthesis (growth), and energy generation and cell maintenance (oxidation). OUR is determined using respirometry, which measures and interprets the rate of biological consumption of oxygen under well-defined experimental conditions. Common respirometry practices include the reaeration method and continuous aeration after kLa determination. OUR is traditionally not used as a process parameter; Rather, respirometry is used for influent characterization (biological oxygen demand, influent fractionation, …) and toxicity fingerprinting (Spanjers et al. 1998).

The initial volumetric OUR (vOUR_i) has the potential to be a powerful tool as an online control parameter as it is a direct measurement of the microbial oxygen demand in the reactor under standardized dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration (4 mg O2 L-1). It can be determined by measuring the first declining DO slope in an ex-situ vessel. This way the OUR measurement is independent kLa changes induced by fouling and wastewater characteristics. In biological nutrient removal (BNR) systems, nitrifiers only account for a small fraction of the suspended solids in the mixed liquor based on growth rate, however they impose a significant air demand on the system (1.5 lbs O2 lb BOD-1 versus 4.6 lbs O2 / lb TKN-1).

Nitrifiers are more sensitive to temperature changes as indicated by their Arrhenius factor, requiring a higher solids rentention time (SRT) during winter (Metcalf and Eddy 2003). As vOURi accounts for both, maintaining a stable vOURi in-situ could lead to stable nitrification rates throughout the year in BNR systems unlike mixed liquor (MLSS) or SRT control. The proposed approach could therefore lead to stable year-round effluent total nitrogen (TN), while also allowing for better energy management. OUR control will manage the amount of aeration that is required and therefore will avoid overaerating the reactor during summertime.

Within the energy recovery framework of high-rate activated sludge (HRAS), minimizing oxidation and maximizing energy recovery is imperative. Short SRT has been identified as the key to redirecting as many organics as possible and keeping oxidation low (Jimenez et al. 2015, Rahman et al. 2016). SRT control is relatively complicated and requires multiple sensors and is therefore underutilized in full-scale plants. MLSS control only requires one sensor, but does not take into account the incoming wastewater composition and active fraction, which have been found to significantly influence the high-rate system (Miller et al. 2016). vOURi is directly linked to metabolism, thus the online control of vOURi could potentially manage oxidation within the reactor. Online OUR control might be advantageous to SRT control as it accounts for diurnal patterns and takes into account influent biomass seeding and environmental conditions automatically.

The A-stage of the AB-process is the most popular application because the extremely short SRT (0.3-0.5 days) combined with high loading (> 2 kg COD kg VSS-1 d-1) minimizes oxidation and maximizes sorption onto sludge (Böhnke et al. 1998, De Graaff and Roest 2012). These operational conditions can lead to a very dynamic process, with biomass inventory and bioflocculation properties fluctuating rapidly. Bioflocculation has known to deteriorate if the food to microbe ratio (F/M ratio) drops below a critical threshold, although the numeric value of this threshold is yet unknown (Rahman et al. 2016). Contact-stabilization was able to mitigate this issue by allowing for return activated sludge (RAS) aeration, imposing a feast-famine regime with contact stabilization (CS), thus triggering an effective degree of bioflocculation. However, this modus operandi sacrificed SRT and therefore potential redirection, and thus controlling a balance is needed to effectively maximize carbon redirection and maintain stable carbon capture and process performance.

So far, online OUR control has only been utilized for online characterization of wastewater or ensuring effluent quality in secondary systems by maximizing oxidation (Young et al. 2004). This paper proposes a novel online OUR control to achieve stable year-round effluent TN in BNR systems and the management of active biomass through in HRAS systems.
